              <h2>Workshop summary</h2>
              <p>International Workshop on Reliability of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems (RADAS 2021) seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners to exchange and discuss the reliability issues of the emerging advanced driving assistant systems. As the AV (Autonomous Vehicle) industry is growing exponentially, and according to a report by Market Research Future, the market is expected to hit over $65 billion by 2027. With the recent popularity and attention received by AV industry, advanced driving assistant systems (including many autopilot systems) has become a key driving force of the next-generation AV technology. However, the reliability and safety issues of advanced driving assistant systems have caused wide public concern and touched a nerve of public anxiety, especially when fatal traffic accident happened due to failures of advanced driving assistant systems. This yearâ€™s RADAS centers around two key scopes to bring researchers with diverse background (e.g., reliability, autopilot, AI) to come up with in-depth discussion and solutions for both reliability issues and autopilot techniques: (1) How to better take the advantage of recent reliability techniques and tools to further improve quality of advanceddriving assistant systems, and (2) How to advance and develop reliability theory and methods for AI-Intensive Systems (e.g., autopilot system). As we see that reliability techniques have already significantly contributed to automotive industry, with some initial work to research on AV and autopilot technology. On the other hand, reliability for autopilot is still at a very early stage.</p>
              <p>RADAS 2021 will, therefore, be a workshop, which seeks to develop a cross-domain community that systematically looks into both areas from the new perspective. The workshop will explore the emerging techniques and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the safety, security, quality, and reliability of advanced driving assistant systems that in turn help the development of reliability modeling methods and techniques. We hope RADAS could facilitate to improve autopilot systems with high quality, as well as accelerate the process of system engineering and quality assurance. </p>

            <p class="description">The theme of the workshop is to leverage traditional reliability techniques to better understand advanced driving assistant system and draw strong connections between the two. We aim to apply reliability methods to accomplish the tasks such as failure prediction for advanceddriving assistant system, as well as advance and complement the existing reliability theory and practice for AI-Intensive System.</p>

            <p class="description">Our main goal is to shed light on the direction of applying the principles of reliability theory and methods to advanced driving assistant system and therefore evaluate the robustness of autopilot techniques especially AI-based techniques. The workshop also aims to leverage reliability techniques to advance the efficiency, accuracy, effectiveness, and usefulness of current autopilot techniques.

            <p class="description">
            The audience of ISSRE focuses on general reliability issues of hardware/software systems, which is highly related and would be benefited by leveraging the reliability techniques for advanced driving assistant system. In addition, it would be helpful for the ISSRE community to know at what aspect the reliability theory and methodology should be improved for the AI-Intensive System (e.g., autopilot systems) and make a broader impact to the community.

            Expected background of attendees. Provide the expected or planned number of participants, submissions, and accepted papers. Please explain your reasoning to support this estimate. Include plans for soliciting and selecting workshop participants.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            We expect to attract researchers and practitioners from either reliability or advanced driving assistant system communities to attend the RADAS. The ballpark estimate of the number of participants is 20-30 attendees. We also expect to take in around 12 submissions and eventually 3-4 accepted papers would warrant publication. As the RADAS is the first start-up workshop connecting reliability and autopilot techniques, we hope that the fairly competitive acceptance rate would facilitate high-quality submissions, to eventually build up the workshop to be the home of crossover areas of reliability and advanced driving assistant system.
